## Objectives

### Performance Evaluation

My Stock Portfolio helps assess the historical performance of a portfolio or investment strategy by simulating how it would have performed in the past. This allows investors to gauge the effectiveness of their strategies and make informed decisions based on historical data.

### Risk Assessment

My Stock Portfolio helps in analyzing the risk associated with a particular investment strategy. It allows users to understand the potential drawdowns, volatility, and other risk metrics associated with the portfolio.

### Drawdown Analysis

Examining historical drawdowns (peak-to-trough declines) helps investors assess the resilience of their portfolios during challenging market conditions. My Stock Portfolio allows users to identify and understand the magnitude and duration of drawdowns.

## How to Start

My Stock Portfolio can be accessed by visiting https://my-stock-portfolio.vercel.app for client side. However, for full analysis functionality, the server must be running in the back. You can run the server by cloning the following repository.

```
git clone https://github.com/eshinhw/my-stock-portfolio-server
```

Then, you can follow the instructions to start the server.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes. You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode. See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
